# betacrew_exchange_client

How to run? <br />
Start the server using $ node main.js <br />
Start the client using $ dotnet run <br />
Output is saved in the file output_hhmmss.json in the same directory of client <br />

There is a sample output file named sample_output.json which is alredy committed in this repository. <br />
I have tested this client using Ubuntu 22.04<br />
